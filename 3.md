#Lesson 3: Constructors and Type Introspection

##New Keywords:
 - `__construct`
 - `is_a()`

##Constructors

In the previous exercise, we created a class and instantiated an object based
on the class. We then set the values of properties of the object. However, just
as it's helpful to be able to declare a variable and assign it a value at the
same time (variable definition), it is also helpful to instantiate an object
with the values that the object should contain.

Fortunately, we can do this with a special *constructor* method. In PHP the
constructor method is named `__construct`. Consider the following:

```php
<?php

class Person {
  private $name;

  function __construct($name) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }

  function getName() {
    return $this->name;
  }
}
```

##Type Introspection

PHP comes with some functions to test the type of a given variable, and they
all start with `is_`. For example, to test that a variable is an integer, one
can invoke `is_int()` and it will return true or false.

How can we test that an object is a certain 'type' of object? PHP provides an
`is_a` function that takes as its first parameter the object in question, and
as a second parameter a string of the class you wish to test against.

###Exercise:

 1. Open up Exercise 1, and test that the 'person' returned from our basic
    function indeed returns an instance of 'stdClass'.

 2. Using the class from Exercise 2, create a constructor function that takes
    a $name parameter and assigns that value to the name property.
