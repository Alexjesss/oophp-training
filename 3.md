# Lesson 3: Constructors

## New Keywords:
 - `__construct`

## Constructors

In the previous exercise, we created a class and instantiated an object based on the class. We then
manually set the values of properties of the object. 

It is often helpful to be able to declare an instance and assign values at the same time.

Fortunately, we can do this with a special *constructor* method. In PHP the constructor method is
named `__construct`. Any method you see in object oriented PHP with two leading underscores is a
*special* method provided by the language.

Consider the following:

```php
<?php

class Person {
  private $name;

  public function __construct($name) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }

  public function getName() {
    return $this->name;
  }
}
```

In the above example the $name value is required each time we instantiate an object. The following
example will return an error.

```php
<?php

$myperson = new Person();
```

You can allow an object to be instantiated with default values by setting the constructor to use
default values on the arguments, like for any other PHP function.

```php
<?php

class Person {
  private $name;

  function __construct($name = NULL) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }
}
```

### Typing Data
We can use type hinting to ensure that arguments passed to methods (or any PHP function in general)
are of a certain type. If the given value is of the incorrect type, then an error is generated: 
- In PHP 5, this will be a fatal error.
- PHP 7 will throw a TypeError exception.

```php
<?php

class Person {
  private $name;
  private $mom;

  function __construct($name = NULL) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }
  
  function setMom(Person $mom) {
    $this->mom = $mom;
  }
}
```

### Exercise:

 1 Using the class from Exercise 2, create a constructor function that takes
    a $name parameter and assigns that value to the name property.

 2. Add 'height' and 'haircolor' to your constructor.
