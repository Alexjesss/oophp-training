#Lesson 3: Constructors and Type Introspection

##New Keywords:
 - `__construct`
 - `is_a()`

##Constructors

In the previous exercise, we created a class and instantiated an object based
on the class. We then manually set the values of properties of the object. 

It is often helpful to be able to be able to declare an instance and assign values at the
same time.

Fortunately, we can do this with a special *constructor* method. In PHP the
constructor method is named `__construct`. Any method you see in object oriented PHP with two leading underscores is a *special* method provided by the language.

Consider the following:

```php
<?php

class Person {
  private $name;

  function __construct($name) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }

  function getName() {
    return $this->name;
  }
}
```

In the above example the $name value is requried each time we instantiate an object. The following example will will return an error.

```php
<?php
$myperson = new Person()
```
If you would like to allow an object to be instantiated with default values you can allow for this using a default constructor as represented in the following example.

```php
<?php
class Person {
  private $name;

  function __construct($name = 'null') {
    $this->name = $name;
  }
}
```

##Type Introspection

PHP comes with some functions to test the type of a given variable, and they
all start with `is_`. For example, to test that a variable is an integer, one
can invoke `is_int()` and it will return true or false.

How can we test that an object is a certain 'type' of object? PHP provides an
`is_a` function that takes as its first parameter the object in question, and
as a second parameter a string of the class you wish to test against.

###Exercise:

 1. Open up Exercise 1, and test that the 'person' returned from our basic
    function indeed returns an instance of 'stdClass'.

 2. Using the class from Exercise 2, create a constructor function that takes
    a $name parameter and assigns that value to the name property.
