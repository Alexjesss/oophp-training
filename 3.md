#Lesson 3: Constructors and Type Introspection

##New Keywords:
 - `__construct`
 - `is_a()`

##Constructors
In the previous exercise, we created a class and instanciated an object based
on the class. We then set the values of properties of the object. However, just 
as it's helpful to be able to declare a variable and assign it a value at the same
time, it is also helpful to instanciate an object with the values that the
object should contain.

Fortunately, we can do this with a special *constructor* method. In PHP the
constructor method is named `__construct`. Consider the following:

```php
<?php

class Person {
  private $name;

  function __construct($name) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }

  function getName() {
    return $this->name;
  }
}
```

##Type Introspection
PHP comes with some functions to test the type of a given variable, and they
all start with `is_`. For example, to test that a variable is an integer, can
invoke `is_int()` and it will return true or false.

How can we test that an object is a certain 'type' of object? PHP provides an
`is_a` function that takes as its first parameter the object in question, and
as a second paramter a string of the class you wish to test against.

###Exercise:
Open up the Excercise 1, and test that the 'person' returned from our basic
function indeed returns a 'stdClass'.

Open up Exercise 2, create a constructor function that takes a $name parameter
and assigns that value to the name property.
