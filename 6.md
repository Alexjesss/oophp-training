# Lesson 6: Abstraction

## New Keywords:

 - `abstract`
 - `final`

"An abstraction denotes the essential characteristics of an object that
distinguish it from all other kinds of objects and thus provide crisply defined
conceptual boundaries relative to the perspective of the viewer."

## Abstract Classes

*An abstract class cannot be instantiated, but rather, _child classes_ can be
extended from the abstract class.*

Abstract classes are typically used as a means to organize a project.  You
can't create an object from an abstract class. Instead, a child class extends
an abstract class, and then an object can be instantiated from the child class.

The child class *must* implement all of the abstract methods listed in the
*parent class*. PHP doesn't use abstract properties, only methods, so you can
signify an abstract property, but PHP doesn't force you to use it in the
implementing classes.

A class can be declared as abstract by using the `abstract` keyword before
`class`, and any abstract methods must also use the `abstract` keyword.

Private methods cannot be declared as abstract, only public or protected
methods.

### Example:

```php
<?php

abstract class ContentEntityBase {
  // ... Other properties and methods.
  
  public function id() {
    return $this->getEntityKey('id');
  }
}

class Node extends ContentEntityBase {
  // ... Other properties and methods.
}
```

Abstract classes can have concrete methods defined. This allows for
classes that only *partially* need to be implemented by a derived class. In the
example above, the `id` concrete method will be available to classes that
extend the `ContentEntityBase` class.

If you fail to implement all of the abstract methods outlined in the abstract
class in a child concrete class, PHP will throw an error.

Remember that abstract methods are only declarations, and that concrete
methods must contain a function body whereas abstract methods do not.

PHP will throw an error if:

 - a method in the abstract class isn't implemented in a derived class.
 - an implemented method doesn't abide by its signature (parameters)
 - the method is of a different visibility than specified

We can extend an abstract into a concrete class by using the `extends` keyword:


```php
<?php

abstract class Query {
  // ... Other properties and methods.
  
  /**
   * Runs the query against the database.
   */
  abstract protected function execute();
  
  /**
   * The toString operation is how we compile a query object to a prepared statement.
   */
  abstract public function __toString();
  
  /**
   * Returns a unique identifier for this object.
   */
  public function uniqueIdentifier() {
    return $this->uniqueIdentifier;
  }
}

class Select extends Query {
  // ... Other properties and methods.
  
  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function execute() {
    if (!$this->preExecute()) {
      return NULL;
    }

    $args = $this->getArguments();
    return $this->connection->query((string) $this, $args, $this->queryOptions);
  }
  
  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function __toString() {
    if (!$this->compiled()) {
      $this->compile($this->connection, $this);
    }
    
    // SELECT
    $query = 'SELECT ';
    if ($this->distinct) {
      $query .= 'DISTINCT ';
    }
    
    // More processing.
    return $query;
  }
}
```

## Exercise:

 - Create an abstract class out of the Person class from lesson 2.
 - Create a concrete class that extends the abstract class.
 - Instantiate an object from the concrete class.
 - Set the name of the person object, and then echo it back out.
