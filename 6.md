#Lesson 6: Design Patterns

##Program to an interface, not an implementation.

This decouples design from the specific implementation of concrete classes, and
allows you to swap out one implementation for another easily, as well as create
new implementations.

In PHP we can accomplish this by specifying interface data types in type
hinting as shown in the previous lesson. It is important to note that by
'interface data types', we mean interfaces _or_ abstract classes.

Also, as previously noted, we can instanciate an object of a given concrete
implementation, and so long as it implements an interface or extends an
abstract class, those parent classes will be used to identify the object curing
type hinting.

##Favor object composition over class inheritance.

If at all possible, try to create client classes that are composed of various
objects.

Consider the following classes:

1. Inheritance

```php
<?php

class Pet {
  function speak() {
    echo 'speaking';
  }
}

class Dog inherits Pet {
  function bite() {
    echo '\/\/\/';
  }
}

class Client {
  function __construct() {
    $dog = new Dog();
  }
}
```

This contrived example shows a client class that uses an object.
