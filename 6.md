#Lesson 6: Static Properties

##New Keywords:

 - `static`

##Not Static Variables

You may have seen the use of `static` inside non-OO functions. Static variables keep their values across multiple function calls.

```php
function test()
{
    static $a = 0;
    echo $a . "\n";
    $a++;
}

test();
test();
```

##Static Keyword in Classes

Declaring class properties or methods as static makes them accessible without needing an instantiation of the class.

An attribute declared as static **cannot** be accessed with an instantiated class object.

A method declared as static **can** be accessed with an instantiated class object.

```php
class Dog {
  static $numLegs = 4;

  static function hasClaws() {
    return TRUE;
  }

  function bark() {
    echo "bow wow\n";
  }
}

class MyDog {
  static $numLegs = 3;

  function bark() {
    echo "bow ow\n";
  }
}

echo "Most dogs have " . Dog::$numLegs . " legs.\n";
echo "Can dogs scratch? " . Dog::hasClaws() . "\n";

$dog = new MyDog();

echo "My dog has " . MyDog::$numLegs . " legs.\n";
// Not
// echo "My dog has " . $dog->numLegs . " legs.\n";
```

###Exercise:

 1. Expand the "Person" class with a SSN property, and add a static method that finds a person by SSN. (Hypothetical implementation).
