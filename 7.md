# Lesson 7: Interfaces

## New Keywords:

 - `interface`
 - `implements`
 - `instanceOf`

Interfaces closely resemble abstract classes, but cannot contain concrete
methods or properties. In order to create an interface, use the `interface`
keyword.

```php
<?php

interface EntityInterface {
  // ... Other constants or methods.
  public function id();
  public function label();
}
```

You can then implement an interface with another class by using the
`implements` keyword. Just as concrete classes can contain additional
properties and methods to augment an abstract class, so can implementing classes contain more
properties/methods than declared in the interfaces; i.e., implementing classes need to comply with
the interface, and they can add any other thing they need.
Interfaces can also extend other interfaces.

```php
<?php

abstract class Entity implements EntityInterface {
  // ... Other constants or methods.
  
  public function id() {
    return isset($this->id) ? $this->id : NULL;
  } 

  public function label() {
    // Processing to return the label.
    return $label;
  }
}
```

### Constants

You can't use variables inside of an interface, but you can use constants.

```php
<?php

interface NodeInterface {
  const NOT_PUBLISHED = 0;
  const PUBLISHED = 1;

  // ... Other constants or methods.
}
```

Those constants can be accessed via the scope resolution operator `::` inside
of an implementing class. For example:

```php
<?php

$node->set('status', NodeInterface::PUBLISHED);

```

### `instanceOf`

The `instanceof` operator is used to find out if an object is an instantiated instance of a class. This
can be useful to make sure that a parameter or variable is a particular instance of an object before
using it. It is particularly useful to check against an interface, which is more generic than an
implementing class.

```php
<?php

function hook_entity_presave(EntityInterface $entity) {
  if ($entity instanceof ContentEntityInterface && $entity->isTranslatable()) {
    $route_match = \Drupal::routeMatch();
    \Drupal::service('content_translation.synchronizer')->synchronizeFields($entity, $entity->language()->getId(), $route_match->getParameter('source_langcode'));
  }
}

```

### Drupal Examples:
Entities are a great place to look at interfaces. An interface allows developers wishing
to create a custom entity to do so simply by adhering to the interface.

Drupal's content entities (`NodeInterface`, '`CommentInterface`, `UserInterface`, etc.) extend the 
`ContentEntityInterface` and in that way provide a unified way to access all of the content entities
and provide a consistent API for module developers.


## Exercise:

 - Create a person interface that declares the methods "work()" and "sayHi()".
 - Modify the abstract class Person so it implements that interface.
 - Instantiate an object from a concrete class.
 - Review what errors does PHP give when a method declared in the interface is missing on the
 implementing class.
