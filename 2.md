#Lesson 2: Introduction to classes.

###New keywords
 - `class`
 - `$this`
 - `public`
 - `private`
 - `protected`

Classes provide a factory to create objects with. Other analogies given are
'cookie cutter', 'object template'.

The classic analogy is that the class represents a blueprint, and we
*instanciate* (create instances from) a class in order to assign an instance of
the class to a variable. With a blueprint of a house, one can construct
a 'house object'.

For example, we might have a Person class that represents a person. The person
might have properties such as a name, a height, a weight, a date of birth, etc,
etc. A person might have some ability to walk, which we could represent as
a method. We can use classes to model real world.

###The class keyword

The `class` keyword takes a code block that represents an object factory.

Inside the code block, _properties_ and _methods_ are created. 

Objects are instantiated out of classes by using the `new` keyword
Here is a completely bare `Person` class

```php
<?php

class Person {
}

$person = new Person();
```

###Property visibility
One interesting thing to note is that each property can have an associated
level of visibility. There are three types visibility a property can have are
`public`, `private`, and `protected`.

Public properties are ones that directly accessible by the instantiated object.

Private properties cannot be accessed anywhere except from within the class. This
allows one to create a public interface, where some critical internal state can
be protected.

I'll discuss the `protected` visibility later as it's dependent upon
understanding inheritance.

Methods created without a declared visibility default to public. Keep in mind
that all non-method properties must be declared `public`, `private`, or `protected`. 

```php
class Person {
  private $name;

  public function setName($name) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }

  public getName() {
    return $this->name;
  }
}

$person = new Person();
$person->name = 'error'; // This will error out because it's a private property
$person->setName('Alice');
echo $person->getName(); // Alice
```
