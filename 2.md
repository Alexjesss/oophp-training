## Lesson 2: Visibility

##### New keywords
- `public`
- `private`
- `protected`

## Visibility

One interesting thing to note is that each method and property can have an associated level of
visibility, which enables information-hiding. The three types of visibility are public, private,
and protected.

- *Public* properties are ones that directly accessible in the instantiated object.
- *Private* properties cannot be accessed anywhere except from within the class. This allows one to
create a public interface, where some critical internal state can be protected.
- We will discuss the *protected* visibility later as it's dependent upon understanding inheritance.

Any methods created without a specific declared visibility default to public. Keep in mind that 
properties must be declared public, private, or protected, followed by a normal variable declaration.
This declaration may include an initialization, but this initialization must be a constant value
(must be able to be evaluated at  compile time and must not depend on run-time information in order
to be evaluated). 

```php
<?php

class Person {
  private $name;

  public function setName($name) {
    $this->name = $name;
  }

  public function getName() {
    return $this->name;
  }
}

$person = new Person();
$person->name = 'error'; // This will error out because it's a private property
$person->setName('Alice');
echo $person->getName(); // Alice
```

## Exercises

1. Expand the previous “Person” class, add `setName()`, `getName()` methods.
2. Add a height property, and a getter and setter.
3. Declare the correct “visibility” for each property and method.
4. Invoke `var_dump()` on the person object to inspect it.
