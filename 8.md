# Lesson 8: Traits

## New Keywords:

 - `trait`
 - `use`

Traits are a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages like PHP. It allows software
architects to reuse sets of methods freely in several independent classes living in different class
hierarchies.

A Trait is similar to a class, but only intended to group functionality in a fine-grained and
consistent way. It is not possible to instantiate a Trait on its own. 

A simple way to understand traits and how to use them is to look at them for what they essentially
are: language assisted copy and paste.

```php
<?php

/**
 * Using this trait will add t() and formatPlural() methods to the class.
 */
trait StringTranslationTrait {
  // ... Other properties or methods.
  
  protected function t($string, array $args = [], array $options = []) {
    return new TranslatableMarkup($string, $args, $options, $this->getStringTranslation());
  }
  
  protected function formatPlural($count, $singular, $plural, array $args = [], array $options = []) {
    return new PluralTranslatableMarkup($count, $singular, $plural, $args, $options, $this->getStringTranslation());
  }
}

/**
 * Provides validation of form submissions.
 */
class FormValidator implements FormValidatorInterface {

  use StringTranslationTrait;
  
  // ... Other properties or methods.
}

/**
 * Provides dynamic permissions for nodes of different types.
 */
class NodePermissions {

  use StringTranslationTrait;
  
  // ... Other properties or methods.
}
```
